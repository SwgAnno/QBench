## QBench
Simple Benchmarking tool to assess performance differences in Amazon Bracket devices



# Deutsch

Two example notebooks  implementing Deutsch algorithm with Braket SDK and visualising its results

# QFT

QFT test on Rigetti, Ionq and OQC devices.

Implementation on the two superconducting qubits devices follows the one given in  aws/amazon-braket-examples  repository.

CPhase for IonQ hardware had to be implemented from scratch, not being directly avaliable in the braket SDK

The notebooks includes results of some 3 to 10 qubits QFT launched one the various devices

A last notebook tries a QPE implementation

# Ionq_compiler

# To do
Migliorare come vengono plottati i grafici per la QPE, eliminando i Query qubit
